# typescript-matchmaking
Experimental matchmaking using typescript. Project is in progress, currently it will find the first match and continues. In the future, I plan to make it do all team combinations and using the team total rating, make the teams as equal as possible.

At the moment, parties dont work, only individual players. However I plan to fully implement this in the future
